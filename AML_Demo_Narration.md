## 🧪 Case 1: High-Frequency Sender – Potential Structuring

**Transaction ID:** 11  
**Sender (ACCOUNT_ID):** 26  
**Receiver (COUNTER_PARTY_ACCOUNT_NUM):** 20  
**Amount:** $143.41  
**Type:** DEPOSIT  
**Step:** 3  

💬 **Narration:**  
> “In this case, the sender has made multiple transactions in a short period — a classic indicator of potential layering or structuring.  
> Even though the amount is below reporting thresholds, the frequency raises concern.  
> As a Tier 1 Analyst, I would flag this as suspicious and escalate to Tier 2.”

## 🧭 Case 2: Frequent Receiver – Possible Mule Account

**Transaction ID:** 2  
**Sender (ACCOUNT_ID):** 15  
**Receiver (COUNTER_PARTY_ACCOUNT_NUM):** 25  
**Amount:** $125.05  
**Type:** CHECK  
**Step:** 1  

💬 **Narration:**  
> “This account has received deposits from multiple different senders.  
> That’s often how mule accounts behave — laundering money by funneling small amounts from various sources.  
> I would place a hold on this and recommend escalation to compliance.”

## ❌ Case 3: Likely False Positive

**Transaction ID:** 29  
**Sender (ACCOUNT_ID):** 14  
**Receiver (COUNTER_PARTY_ACCOUNT_NUM):** 21  
**Amount:** $161.83  
**Type:** DEPOSIT  
**Step:** 11  

💬 **Narration:**  
> “While this transaction has a relatively high amount compared to others, it’s an isolated case.  
> There’s no prior alert, no pattern, and no suspicious counterparties.  
> I would mark this to monitor but not escalate or file a SAR at this stage.”

🎯 **Wrap-Up Suggestion:**  
End your demo by showing the SAR dashboard. Emphasize how the tool helps analysts make consistent decisions, escalate only when warranted, and document everything for audits.
